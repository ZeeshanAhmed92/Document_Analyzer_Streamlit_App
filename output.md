External Audit 2024‚Äã
‚Äã
O-2024-02: Some documents have been written in a very general sense 
and still have traces of the original instructions.‚Äã
We fixed the specific findings and rewrite chapters of the policy when we 
update these for another reason. (Task)‚Äã
 
O-2024-01 - Stakeholder analysis - co-tennants‚Äã
We added the co-tennants in the stakeholder analysis. No associated risks 
(Task). 
 
O-2024-03: Segregation of duties is determined based on Zoho rights 
and financial system rights. 5.3 Segregation of duties has been tied to 
a risk of employees not knowing‚Äã
Risk mapping has been redone‚Äã

NC-B-2024-01: Operational planning and control 
We scheduled regular meetings with the ISWG of other group companies 
and restructured the ISMS and task system for better overview and 
integration.‚Äã
‚Äã
O-2024-04: the organization may need a formal DPO due to the large 
scale of clients on the platform for which the organization monitors 
course work and results.‚Äã
The management of E-WISE and Blueprint Learning investigated this topic 
and it did not meet the requirements of the GDPR authority. An internal DPO 
is deemed sufficient. Risk 3.4 is raised for this and accepted.‚Äã

O-2024-06: Policy documentation at Thar is not shared in the same

## File: Evidence controls are applied/A.5.25/#18- CAPA-form [Confidential] - possible confidential sales data leaked during offboarding of employee .docx.pdf


## Page 1
 
CAPA  Reference No.: 18 
Start Date:   26-4-2025 
Non Conformity / Improvement/ Preventive Action: 
An employee that was leaving involuntarily sent some confidential data to an external mail address 
Details 
An employee's contract was not renewed due to inadequate performance. After an interview was held, 
colleague saw that some documents on a shared drive were missing. Based on this,  the Operational Director 
of E-WISE started an investigation on june 5th of the mail behaviour of the employee by  Reducate system 
administrator.  
 
This employee sent some email messages containing information about customers to his own external email 
address. This involved names and business email addresses of these customers. This involved a total of 29 
emails  
In addition, there are indications that this person opened the company applications on a private laptop. This 
is against the Information Security Policy 
After this was discovered, E-WISE filed a lawsuit against this person to ensure the information would be 
destroyed. 
In the settlement agreement (VSO) the employee agrees that she does not hold any information anymore 
that belongs to the E-WISE business.‚Äã

Commentary: The use of External Service Providers and the outsourcing of services is 
more prevalent today than ever before. However there are several risks associated with 
outsourcing, since the control of the operations lie outside the organisation.  
 
To measure the performance of our services for our stakeholders like customers we have set 
up the below goals and KPIs.
