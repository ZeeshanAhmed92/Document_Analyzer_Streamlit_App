The purpose of the Business Continuity Plan is to define precisely how E-WISE will manage 
incidents in the case of a disaster or other disruptive incident, and how it will recover its activities 
within set deadlines.  
 
The objective of this plan is to keep the damage of a disruptive incident at an acceptable level. 
This plan is applied to all critical activities inside the scope of the Information Security 
Management System (ISMS). 
 
Users of this document are all staff members, both inside and outside the organization, who 
have a role in business continuity. This policy revision 1.0 will come into effect from 13-06-2022.

Section - 2.4 Plan activation; plan deactivation 
 
The Incident Response Plan is activated automatically in case an incident occurs, or a potential 
incident is threatening its activities. The Incident Response Plan is deactivated after an incident has 
been contained or eradicated. 
Disaster Recovery Plan and recovery plans for particular activities are activated exclusively by the 
Operational Director’s decision, if he/she assesses that a particular activity will be interrupted for a 
period longer than the recovery time objective for that activity. The decision of the Operational Director 
may be written or oral. 
Disaster Recovery Plan and recovery plans may be deactivated by recovery managers for individual 
activities when they establish that all conditions for the resumption of business activities have been 
met. Disaster Recovery Plan and recovery plans are deactivated by resuming normal business 
activities. 
Section - 2.5 Communication 
 
The following means will be used for communication between the Crisis Management Team and 
activities, and between activities themselves - they are ordered according to priority (the first one from 
the list is to be used first; in case it is not available, the next one is used): 
Affects e-learning environment (See appendix 7 - communication templates) 
1.​ A status page 
2.​ Chat tool 
3.​ Email 
4.​ Social media 
5.​ Press release

Chapter 3 Restoring and resuming business 
activities from temporary measures 
 
The purpose of restoration and resuming the business activities from temporary measures is to bring 
the business operations back to business-as-usual – to the normal state as it was prior to the 
disruptive incident. 
The steps described in this section are not time critical – they are to be performed in proportion with 
the impact of the disruptive incident and in accordance with available resources. The decision to 
activate each of the following steps is made by the Operational Director. 
The following steps need to be performed, in this order: 
1.​ Preservation of the damaged assets and evaluation of damage 
2.​ Assessment of the situation and determining options and responsibilities 
3.​ Developing an action plan – determining the steps needed to return activities to normal state 
Section - 3.1 Preservation of damaged assets and evaluation of 
damage 
 
The board of directors, IT-director or ISCC will nominate the team for preserving the damaged assets 
– the focus of this team is to prevent the damage from spreading. 
The board of directors, IT-director or ISCC will nominate the team for evaluation of damage. The 
evaluation must consist of the following: name of the asset, location of the asset, type of damage, and 
cost of damage. 
Section - 3.2 Assessment of the situation & determining options 
and responsibilities 
 
Depending on the extent of the damage, the Operational Director needs to decide the following: (1) 
whether to move back to the primary location or look for a new location, (2) whether to purchase new 
equipment or repair the existing, (3) when and where the operations of activities that do not support 
key products and services (activities with lower priority) will be recovered/resumed, and (4) whether 
there are enough human resources to support normal operations, etc.

f)​

h)​ Recovering lower priority activities 
 
Section - 3.3 Developing action plans 
 
Each responsible person must develop an action plan for his/her area of responsibility, which will – 
amongst other information – contain the following: (1) steps to be taken, (2) required human 
resources, (3) required financial resources, and (4) deadlines. 
The Operational Director must define (1) how to provide necessary funding, (2) procurement process 
and authorizations, (3) which reports will be sent to the Crisis Management Team, and (4) who will
