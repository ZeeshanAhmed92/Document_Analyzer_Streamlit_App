  <h1>ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analyse</h1>

  <section class="section" id="scope-of-gap">
    <h2>1. Scope of the GAP</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Applicability</h3>
    <p>This internal audit covers the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of <strong>Vlectra</strong> as defined under the scope of its ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, in accordance with the internal audit planning for that standard.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Participants in the Audit</h3>
    <p>The internal audit was conducted on <em>[date-of-report]</em>, focusing on the management system in place at <strong>Vlectra</strong>.</p>
    <p>Participants:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>On behalf of <strong>Vlectra</strong>:</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>[name-1]</li>
        <li>[name-2]</li>
        <li>[name-3]</li>
      </ul>
      <li>On behalf of Valecta:</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>Stephan Csorba</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
    <p>The audit was carried out in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard by Valecta.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Audit Objectives</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this GAP-analyse was to assess, on a sample basis, the functioning and effectiveness of the ISMS as implemented at <strong>Vlectra</strong> in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Scope of Entities Included in the Internal Audit</h3>
    <p>This internal audit included the following legal entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vlectra</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="executive-summary">
    <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Sampling Methodology</h3>
    <p>Please note that the audit was conducted based on a sampling approach, meaning that findings and conclusions are based on a selected sample of processes and data, not on 100% evaluation. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance rather than absolute certainty. This methodology proved effective and enabled the organization to identify targeted improvement actions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 General Impressions of the Management System</h3>
    <p>The ISMS at Vlectra demonstrates a strong commitment to information security, with comprehensive policies and procedures aligned to ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements. Most controls are well implemented and supported by documented evidence, reflecting mature organizational and technological security practices.</p>

    <h3>2.2.1 Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Comprehensive Information Security Policy covering scope, responsibilities, enforcement, and management commitment.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Well-defined access control, identity management, and authentication policies with supporting evidence.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Effective incident management procedures including monitoring, reporting, and response coordination.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Strong supplier relationship management with contracts including security clauses and risk assessments.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Robust backup and restoration policies with documented testing and off-site storage.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Active security awareness, training, and disciplinary processes ensuring compliance.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Secure physical access controls and media disposal policies in place.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Documented secure development lifecycle and application security testing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.2 Findings</h3>
    <p>While the ISMS is largely compliant, some areas require further documentation or explicit evidence to fully demonstrate compliance and control effectiveness. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information labelling guidelines and evidence of their application are not explicitly documented.</li>
      <li>Cloud services security controls and approval processes lack explicit documented evidence.</li>
      <li>Intellectual property rights management and software licensing procedures need formal documentation.</li>
      <li>Records protection, secure disposal, and backup media policies require clearer evidence.</li>
      <li>Remote working and mobile device protection policies are not explicitly documented.</li>
      <li>Cabling security controls per local or European regulations are not evidenced.</li>
      <li>Physical security monitoring lacks explicit CCTV or continuous monitoring documentation.</li>
      <li>Environmental threat protection controls (fire, flood, power failure) are insufficiently detailed.</li>
      <li>Equipment siting and protection from environmental hazards need formal policies.</li>
      <li>Technical redundancy controls for information processing facilities are not explicitly documented.</li>
      <li>Protection of information systems during audit testing is not clearly addressed.</li>
      <li>Equipment maintenance policy is limited and requires comprehensive coverage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.3 Non-conformities identified</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented information labelling procedures and evidence.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Missing explicit cloud services security controls and approval evidence.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No formal documentation or evidence for intellectual property rights compliance.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Insufficient documented evidence for records protection and secure disposal.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Absence of documented remote working and mobile device protection policies.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented cabling security controls per regulations.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Physical security monitoring lacks CCTV or continuous monitoring documentation.</li>

      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Equipment siting and environmental protection policies are missing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No explicit technical redundancy controls documented for critical facilities.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented controls for protection during audit testing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Equipment maintenance policy coverage is limited and lacks detail.</li>
    </ul>
