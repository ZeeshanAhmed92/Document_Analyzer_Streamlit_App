  <h1>ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analyse</h1>

  <section class="section" id="scope-of-gap">
    <h2>1. Scope of the GAP</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Applicability</h3>
    <p>This internal audit covers the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of Zeeshan as defined under the scope of its ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, in accordance with the internal audit planning for that standard.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Participants in the Audit</h3>
    <p>The internal audit was conducted on 2025-07-09, focusing on the management system in place at Zeeshan.</p>
    <p>Participants:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>On behalf of Zeeshan</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>Shaharyar</li>
        <li>Hasaan</li>
      </ul>
      <li>On behalf of Valecta</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>Stephan Csorba</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
    <p>The audit was carried out in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard by Valecta.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Audit Objectives</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this GAP-analyse was to assess, on a sample basis, the functioning and effectiveness of the ISMS as implemented at Zeeshan in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Scope of Entities Included in the Internal Audit</h3>
    <p>This internal audit included the following legal entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zeeshan</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="executive-summary">
    <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Sampling Methodology</h3>
    <p>Please note that the audit was conducted based on a sampling approach, meaning that findings and conclusions are based on a selected sample of processes and data, not on 100% evaluation. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance rather than absolute certainty. This methodology proved effective and enabled the organization to identify targeted improvement actions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 General Impressions of the Management System</h3>
    <p>The ISMS at Zeeshan demonstrates a strong alignment with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements, with comprehensive policies and procedures established across organizational, people, physical, and technological controls. Management commitment is evident through regular reviews, defined roles and responsibilities, and documented evidence of policy implementation. However, some areas require further documentation and formalization to fully close identified gaps.</p>

    <h3>2.2.1 Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Well-defined Information Security Policy covering scope, enforcement, roles, and management commitment.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Effective access control and identity management processes with documented user registration and periodic reviews.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Comprehensive incident management procedures including response, assessment, and learning from incidents.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Strong backup and disaster recovery planning with successful restore tests documented.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Regular internal and external audits with management reviews and security awareness training.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Supplier relationships managed with contracts, SLAs, and risk assessments.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Physical security controls including access restrictions, key management, and secure disposal of equipment.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Network security maintained with firewalls, encryption, logging, and monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.2 Findings</h3>
    <p>While the ISMS is largely compliant, several controls lack explicit documented procedures or evidence, which may impact audit confidence. Some policies are implied or partially documented but require formalization. The following areas were noted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information labelling procedures are not explicitly documented or evidenced.</li>
      <li>Intellectual property rights compliance procedures are missing.</li>
      <li>Integration of information security in project management and SDLC lacks explicit documentation.</li>
      <li>Data masking and data leakage prevention controls are not established.</li>
      <li>Controls for privileged utility programs and access to source code need formal documentation.</li>
      <li>Physical security monitoring such as CCTV or intrusion detection is not documented.</li>
      <li>Supporting utilities controls (e.g., HVAC, fire suppression) require development and documentation.</li>
      <li>Remote working policy is implied but not formally documented.</li>
      <li>Equipment siting and off-premises asset security controls need formalization.</li>
      <li>Protection of information systems during audit testing is not explicitly addressed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.3 Non-conformities identified:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented procedures for information labelling and handling.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No formal intellectual property rights compliance procedures.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Missing documented integration of information security in project management and SDLC.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Absence of data masking and data leakage prevention policies.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented controls for privileged utility programs and source code access.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Physical security monitoring (e.g., CCTV) not implemented or documented.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Supporting utilities controls are not comprehensively documented.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Formal remote working policy is missing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Equipment siting and off-premises asset security controls are insufficiently documented.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No explicit procedures protecting information systems during audit testing.</li>
    </ul>
