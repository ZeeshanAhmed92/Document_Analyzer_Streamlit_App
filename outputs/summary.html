  <h1>ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analyse</h1>

  <section class="section" id="scope-of-gap">
    <h2>1. Scope of the GAP</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Applicability</h3>
    <p>This internal audit covers the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of Zeeshan as defined under the scope of its ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, in accordance with the internal audit planning for that standard.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Participants in the Audit</h3>
    <p>The internal audit was conducted on <span class="note">[date-of-report]</span>, focusing on the management system in place at Zeeshan.</p>
    <p>Participants:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>On behalf of Zeeshan</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>Shaharyar</li>
        <li>Hasaan</li>
      </ul>
      <li>On behalf of Valecta</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>Stephan Csorba</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
    <p>The audit was carried out in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard by Valecta.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Audit Objectives</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this GAP-analyse was to assess, on a sample basis, the functioning and effectiveness of the ISMS as implemented at Zeeshan in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Scope of Entities Included in the Internal Audit</h3>
    <p>This internal audit included the following legal entities:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>Zeeshan</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="executive-summary">
    <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Sampling Methodology</h3>
    <p>Please note that the audit was conducted based on a sampling approach, meaning that findings and conclusions are based on a selected sample of processes and data, not on 100% evaluation. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance rather than absolute certainty. This methodology proved effective and enabled the organization to identify targeted improvement actions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 General Impressions of the Management System</h3>
    <p>The ISMS at Zeeshan demonstrates a strong commitment to information security with comprehensive policies and procedures aligned to ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Many controls are well documented and implemented, supported by management reviews and evidence of ongoing monitoring. However, some areas lack documented evidence or formal procedures, indicating opportunities for further strengthening the ISMS.</p>

    <h3>2.2.1 Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Comprehensive Information Security Policy covering scope, responsibilities, enforcement, and management commitment.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Effective incident management procedures with monthly ISSC briefings and CAPA forms usage.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Strong password and authentication policies including two-factor authentication and complexity requirements.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Well-defined roles and responsibilities for information security across the organization.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Documented backup and restoration policies with successful restore tests.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Supplier relationship management with contracts, SLAs, and risk assessments in place.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Secure disposal and handling of information storage media and equipment.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Documented change management and secure development lifecycle policies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.2 Findings</h3>
    <p>While many controls are implemented effectively, the audit identified several areas where documented evidence or formal procedures are missing or incomplete. These gaps may impact the full assurance of compliance and effectiveness of the ISMS.</p>

    <h3>2.2.3 Non-conformities identified:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✗</span> Lack of documented evidence for Acceptable Use Policy enforcement and disciplinary actions.</li>
