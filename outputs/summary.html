  <h1>ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analyse</h1>

  <section class="section" id="scope-of-gap">
    <h2>1. Scope of the GAP</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Applicability</h3>
    <p>This internal audit covers the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of <strong>Vlectra</strong> as defined under the scope of its ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, in accordance with the internal audit planning for that standard.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Participants in the Audit</h3>
    <p>The internal audit was conducted on <em>[date-of-report]</em>, focusing on the management system in place at <strong>Vlectra</strong>.</p>
    <p>Participants:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>On behalf of Vlectra</li>
      <li>[name-1]</li>
      <li>[name-2]</li>
      <li>[name-3]</li>
      <li>On behalf of Valecta</li>
      <li>Stephan Csorba</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
    <p>The audit was carried out in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard by Valecta.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Audit Objectives</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this GAP-analyse was to assess, on a sample basis, the functioning and effectiveness of the ISMS as implemented at <strong>Vlectra</strong> in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Scope of Entities Included in the Internal Audit</h3>
    <p>This internal audit included the following legal entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vlectra</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="executive-summary">
    <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Sampling Methodology</h3>
    <p>The audit was conducted based on a sampling approach, meaning that findings and conclusions are based on a selected sample of processes and data, not on 100% evaluation. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance rather than absolute certainty. This methodology proved effective and enabled the organization to identify targeted improvement actions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 General Impressions of the Management System</h3>
    <p>The ISMS at Vlectra demonstrates a strong commitment to information security with comprehensive policies and procedures aligned to ISO/IEC 27001:2022. Most controls are well implemented with documented evidence and active management review processes. However, some gaps remain in documentation completeness and formalization of certain controls.</p>

    <h3>2.2.1 Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Comprehensive Information Security Policy covering scope, objectives, roles, responsibilities, and management review.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Effective access control and identity management with centralized password management and multi-factor authentication.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Strong incident management processes including reporting, response, and learning with CAPA forms and regular ISSC briefings.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Well-defined supplier relationship management with contracts, SLAs, risk assessments, and NDAs.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Regular security awareness training with 100% completion and ongoing communication.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery plans with tested recovery procedures and crisis management.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Secure development lifecycle with documented SDLC, code reviews, and annual PEN-tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.2 Findings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Several controls lack direct documented evidence despite policy statements, including information classification, labelling, information transfer controls, and IT asset inventory.</li>
      <li>Physical security controls such as perimeter security, monitoring (CCTV), and equipment maintenance are not fully documented or evidenced.</li>
      <li>Some technological controls like data masking, data leakage prevention, redundancy of processing facilities, and protection during audit testing require formal documentation and implementation.</li>
      <li>Remote working policy is partially covered but lacks a comprehensive documented policy addressing all aspects of secure remote access and device management.</li>
      <li>Contact with authorities and special interest groups is managed informally; formalized contacts and participation could be improved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.3 Non-conformities identified</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented information classification scheme and periodic review evidence.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented labelling guidelines and evidence of labelling per classification.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Missing documented controls for information transfer including approval and protection measures.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented IT asset inventory or evidence of periodic physical asset checks.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Physical security perimeter and monitoring controls lack documented evidence and formal procedures.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No formal documented equipment maintenance policy covering all IT and physical equipment.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No formal documented remote working policy covering secure access, user responsibilities, and monitoring.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented procedures for protection of information systems during audit and penetration testing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented data masking and data leakage prevention technical controls.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No explicit documented redundancy mechanisms for information processing facilities.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Intellectual property rights compliance procedures not documented.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Documented operating procedures including incident management, change management, backup, and recovery are missing.</li>
    </ul>
