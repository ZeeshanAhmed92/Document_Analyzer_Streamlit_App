  <h1>ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analyse</h1>

  <section class="section" id="scope-of-gap">
    <h2>1. Scope of the GAP</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Applicability</h3>
    <p>This internal audit covers the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of <strong>consultancy</strong> as defined under the scope of its ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, in accordance with the internal audit planning for that standard.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Participants in the Audit</h3>
    <p>The internal audit was conducted on <strong>2025-07-09</strong>, focusing on the management system in place at <strong>consultancy</strong>.</p>
    <p>Participants:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>On behalf of consultancy</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>zeeshan</li>
      </ul>
      <li>On behalf of Valecta</li>
      <ul class="participants-list">
        <li>Stephan Csorba</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
    <p>The audit was carried out in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard by Valecta.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Audit Objectives</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this GAP-analyse was to assess, on a sample basis, the functioning and effectiveness of the ISMS as implemented at <strong>consultancy</strong> in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Scope of Entities Included in the Internal Audit</h3>
    <p>This internal audit included the following legal entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>consultancy</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="executive-summary">
    <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Sampling Methodology</h3>
    <p>Please note that the audit was conducted based on a sampling approach, meaning that findings and conclusions are based on a selected sample of processes and data, not on 100% evaluation. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance rather than absolute certainty. This methodology proved effective and enabled the organization to identify targeted improvement actions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 General Impressions of the Management System</h3>
    <p>The ISMS at consultancy demonstrates a strong foundation with comprehensive policies and procedures aligned to ISO 27001:2022 requirements. Many controls are well documented and supported by evidence from management review meetings and policy documents. However, some areas lack explicit documented evidence or formalized procedures, indicating opportunities for further strengthening the ISMS.</p>

    <h3>2.2.1 Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Information Security Policy is well defined and communicated.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Incident management and response procedures are established and documented.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Access control and identity management policies are implemented with supporting evidence.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Supplier relationships and contracts include information security requirements and are actively managed.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans are in place and tested.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Security awareness training is conducted with full completion rates.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Logging, monitoring, and patch management processes are documented and operational.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.2 Findings</h3>
    <p>While many controls are effectively implemented, the audit identified several areas where documentation or evidence is incomplete or missing. Some policies exist but lack direct supporting evidence of implementation. Additionally, a few controls require formalization or enhancement to meet best practice standards fully.</p>

    <h3>2.2.3 Non-conformities identified:</h3>

      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented evidence of acceptable use policies and enforcement.</li>
