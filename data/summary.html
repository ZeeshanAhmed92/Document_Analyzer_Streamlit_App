  <h1>ISO 27001:2022 Gap Analyse - Vlectra</h1>

  <section class="section" id="scope-of-gap">
    <h2>1. Scope of the GAP</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Applicability</h3>
    <p>This internal audit covers the Information Security Management System (ISMS) of <strong>Vlectra</strong> as defined under the scope of its ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification, in accordance with the internal audit planning for that standard.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Participants in the Audit</h3>
    <p>The internal audit was conducted on <em>[date-of-report]</em>, focusing on the management system in place at <strong>Vlectra</strong>.</p>
    <p>Participants:</p>
    <ul class="participants-list">
      <li>On behalf of <strong>Vlectra</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>[name-1]</li>
          <li>[name-2]</li>
          <li>[name-3]</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>On behalf of Valecta:
        <ul>
          <li>Stephan Csorba</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Audit Criteria</h3>
    <p>The audit was carried out in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standard by Valecta.</p>

    <h3>1.4 Audit Objectives</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this GAP-analyse was to assess, on a sample basis, the functioning and effectiveness of the ISMS as implemented at <strong>Vlectra</strong> in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements.</p>

    <h3>1.5 Scope of Entities Included in the Internal Audit</h3>
    <p>This internal audit included the following legal entities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vlectra</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="section" id="executive-summary">
    <h2>2. Executive Summary</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Sampling Methodology</h3>
    <p>Please note that the audit was conducted based on a sampling approach, meaning that findings and conclusions are based on a selected sample of processes and data, not on 100% evaluation. The goal is to provide reasonable assurance rather than absolute certainty. This methodology proved effective and enabled the organization to identify targeted improvement actions.</p>

    <h3>2.2 General Impressions of the Management System</h3>
    <p>The ISMS at Vlectra demonstrates a strong commitment to information security aligned with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 requirements. Most controls are well documented and implemented, with comprehensive policies covering organizational, people, physical, and technological controls. Management involvement and regular reviews are evident, supporting continuous improvement.</p>

    <h3>2.2.1 Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Comprehensive Information Security Policy with clear roles and responsibilities.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Effective access control and identity management processes including two-factor authentication.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Robust incident management procedures with documented response and learning mechanisms.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Well-maintained asset inventory and classification schemes.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Strong network security with firewalls, segregation, and monitoring.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Documented secure development lifecycle and application security testing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-ok">✔</span> Regular internal and external audits supporting compliance and continual improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.2 Findings</h3>
    <p>While the ISMS is largely compliant, some areas require further documentation or formalization to strengthen controls and ensure full alignment with ISO 27001:2022:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Information classification and information transfer controls need explicit documented procedures.</li>
      <li>Physical security perimeter and entry controls lack explicit documented evidence.</li>
      <li>Cloud services security controls require formal documentation including approvals and TLS testing.</li>
      <li>Contact procedures with authorities and special interest groups should be explicitly documented.</li>
      <li>Data leakage prevention lacks explicit technical controls and monitoring tools.</li>
      <li>Redundancy of information processing facilities and protection during audit testing need formal documented controls.</li>
      <li>Remote working policy and confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements require formal documentation.</li>
      <li>Capacity management and equipment maintenance policies need further formalization and documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2.3 Non-conformities identified</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No explicit documented physical security perimeter controls such as card swipe, alarms, or secured racks.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented NDA requirements and approvals for external providers and employees.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Missing documented cloud service security controls including approval and TLS testing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented procedures for contact with authorities.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No explicit documented controls for protection of information systems during audit and penetration testing.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Lack of documented physical entry controls and secure area visitor escort procedures.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> No documented controls for physical and environmental threat protection.</li>
      <li><span class="status-gap">✘</span> Missing documented cabling security and supporting utilities management.</li>
    </ul>
